# Stock Price Prediction using Kalman Filter and GRU

This project combines a Kalman filter with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network to predict stock prices. The Kalman filter is used for noise reduction and state estimation, while the GRU network learns temporal dependencies in the data to improve prediction accuracy.

## Overview

This approach aims to leverage the strengths of both the Kalman filter and GRUs. The Kalman filter helps to smooth out noisy stock market data and provide better estimates of the underlying trends. The GRU network then learns from this filtered data to capture complex patterns and make more accurate predictions.

## Features

* **Kalman Filter:** Implements a Kalman filter for noise reduction and state estimation in stock price data.
* **GRU Network:** Uses a GRU network to model temporal dependencies in stock price data.
* **Combined Approach:** Integrates the Kalman filter and GRU network for enhanced stock price prediction.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data preprocessing steps (e.g., normalization, scaling) to prepare the stock data for the model.
* **Training and Evaluation:** Provides scripts for training the GRU model and evaluating its performance.
* **Visualization:** *(If implemented)* Includes visualizations of the predicted stock prices compared to the actual prices.
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: A compatible Python version.
Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries (see above).
Stock Data: You'll need historical stock data. (Explain how to obtain the data, e.g., using yfinance, a CSV file, or a specific API.)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/Parasuram19/KalmanFilter_GRU_on_StockMarket_Data.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dhttps://www.google.com/search%253Fq%253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%25253Fq%25253Dhttps://github.com/Parasuram19/KalmanFilter_GRU_on_StockMarket_Data.git)
Navigate to the Directory:

Bash

cd KalmanFilter_GRU_on_StockMarket_Data
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
# OR install individually as shown above
Running the Code
Data Preparation: Prepare your stock data. (Provide detailed instructions on how to do this. This is a critical step.)

Training:

Bash

python train.py  # Replace train.py with the name of your training script
(Explain the training parameters, epochs, batch size, etc.)

Prediction:

Bash

python predict.py  # Replace predict.py with the name of your prediction script
Evaluation: (If implemented)

Bash

python evaluate.py  # Replace evaluate.py with the name of your evaluation script
Data
(Explain the data used in your project, including:)

Stock Ticker: (e.g., AAPL, GOOG)
Data Source: (e.g., Yahoo Finance, a specific API)
Time Period: (e.g., the date range of the historical data)
Features Used: (e.g., Open, High, Low, Close prices, Volume)
Model Architecture
(Describe the architecture of your model. This should include:)

Kalman Filter Parameters: (e.g., process noise, measurement noise)
GRU Network Layers: (Number of layers, neurons per layer)
Other Layers: (e.g., Dense layers, Dropout layers)
Activation Functions:
Optimizer:
Loss Function:
Results
(Include the results of your model's performance. This could include:)

Metrics: (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error)
Visualizations: (e.g., plots of predicted vs. actual prices)
Important Considerations
Stock market prediction is inherently difficult. Past performance is not indicative of future results. This project is for educational purposes and should not be used for actual investment decisions.
Hyperparameter tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Feature engineering: Explore adding more features to potentially improve predictions.
